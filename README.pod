=head1 NAME

Win32-ASP-DB - an object-oriented framework for developing database front-ends
using ASP and PerlScript

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The Win32-ASP-DB framework makes it much easier to deploy robust,
full-featured database front-ends that include widespread business logic.  The
framework makes extensive use of Perl's object-oriented support, including the
flexibility built into that support which allows it to be extended.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

The system relies upon ASP, PerlScript, and ADO very heavily.

It requires the Perl modules C<Error::Unhandled> and C<Class::SelfMethods>,
available on CPAN.

=head1 GETTING STARTED

The documentation is currently 60% completed.  There isn't much, however, in
the way of a tutorial.  I'd recommend looking through the C<DocSample>
directory. After looking through it, you may wish to install it on your IIS
server so that you can play with it from a web browser as well.
